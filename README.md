**Application Overview**  
The application built in python is structured off of 12 functions and is used to create user accounts and characters in the world of dungeons and dragons for those accounts.  
  
An account is required to create a character. Once logged in, the user can create a new character based off of name, race, class, abilities, descriptions, and inventory.  
Almost each function is used to handle the displaying and retrieving of these bases from the website.  
  
**Components**
This application back-end consists of Python, Flask, WTForms, SQLAlchemy, and Postgresql. Further tools used by Python in Flask are Flask-Bcrypt for account password encryption, flask-requests to handle get and post requests, and Jinja2 for passing data from the back-end directly to a web page.  
  
The front-end uses primarily HTML, with some JavaScript and a touch of CSS. Render.com is used to host the website.
